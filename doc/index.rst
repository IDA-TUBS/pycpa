pyCPA is a pragmatic Python implementation of Compositional Performance Analysis
(aka the SymTA/S approach provided by `Symtavision <http://www.symtavision.com>`_) 
used for research in worst-case timing analysis.
Unlike the commercial SymTA/S tool, pyCPA is not intended for commercial-grade use
and does not guarantee correctness of the implementation.
